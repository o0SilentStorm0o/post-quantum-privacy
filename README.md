## Design Direction
The design should feel authoritative and academic, like a research paper brought to life digitally. Clean typography and structured layouts emphasize the serious cryptographic research while interactive elements make complex concepts more approachable.

## Color Selection
Triadic color scheme representing the three core pillars: security, privacy, and compliance.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.3 0.15 250)) - Represents security and trust in cryptographic protocols
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Emerald Green (oklch(0.5 0.15 150)) - Privacy and confidentiality
  - Amber Orange (oklch(0.6 0.15 50)) - Regulatory compliance and transparency
- **Accent Color**: Bright Cyan (oklch(0.7 0.2 200)) - Highlights for post-quantum emphasis and CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(0.98 0 0)): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 19.8:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.96 0 0)): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 18.5:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.3 0.15 250)): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 11.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Cyan oklch(0.7 0.2 200)): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 8.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Clean, technical typography that emphasizes readability for complex cryptographic content and mathematical notation.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Main Title): Inter Bold/48px/tight spacing - "PQ-PRIV: Post-Quantum Privacy Layer-1"
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/32px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Subsection): Inter Medium/24px/normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/1.6 line height for technical readability
  - Code: JetBrains Mono/14px for technical specifications
  - Captions: Inter Regular/14px/muted color for annotations
